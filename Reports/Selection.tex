\section{Topology Selection and Reasoning}
In the second part of this report, all possible topologies are discussed. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each possible solution, Three Pole Machine decided to continue with three phase diode rectifier with buck converter.

We made this decision because it is easier to drive, less expensive and it is more appropriate for low voltage applications such as motor drive. In the following sections, calculations, simulation results and component selection will be provided.
