\section{Conclusion}
In this project, our goal is to drive a DC motor with AC input. In the simulation report provided, we first investigated different topologies. Then, we selected our solution and simulated it in Simulink. Components that will be proper to our rectifier were chosen. This report shows that our solution is working in the theoretical and simulation level. Based on the simulations and the calculations, we will start to construct our project.
