As technology is developed, the necessity for rectifiers and converters increases every day. Three fourth year METU EE Students, named Three Pole Machine introduces AC to DC Motor Drive hardware project. In this report, first approach and simulation results with component selection for proper operation will be discussed. In the first part of this report, briefly different topologies of AC to DC converters will be compared. Their advantages and disadvantages will be stated. Second part, the topology selection will be announced. Simulation results with ideal cases will be introduced. As there is no ideal cases in hardware implementations, the component selection will be approached by providing a proper margin so that our system does not fail. Our main goals from this project is to obtain a robust, simple solution to AC to DC converter. Our system should provide a feedback in order not to have high start-up currents. Also, our system should work in longer periods, it should be endurable. To conclude, this project is an implementation of theoretical knowledge of EE463 lecture. We think that designing such system will develop our engineering skills with problem solution methods.
